                <p>Client-server communication at the physical level minimizes synchronous round-trip calls (i.e. each user action leads to a single - usually asynchronous - request/response pair). The desktop client also archives and encrypts all transferred data (when necessary). During client-server communication (via TCP/IP for the desktop client or HTTP for the Web client), the platform provides guarantee of delivery - it resends any lost requests and ensures that they are processed in the correct order. All these features help the platform run efficiently even on low-bandwidth, unstable, or high-latency communication channels.</p>

In addition, the platform supports access to any external systems at the language level via HTTP, as well as SQL servers, other lsFusion systems, etc. And, since the server itself is implemented as a Spring bean, you can manage its life cycle using a standard Spring IoC container. All these features allow you to use lsFusion not only as a full-fledged development platform, but also as a database or even a Java library.</p>

                <p>The application server runs on a Java virtual machine (JVM) and can thus be integrated with countless Java libraries. To do this, just create your own action in Java, register it in the platform, and then use it just like any action built into the platform or written on the platform's built-in language. Accordingly, you can seamlessly connect custom SQL functions of the database server you're using.</p>

This allows you to use popular version control systems (Git, Subversion) and project-building tools (Maven in IDEs) when working with projects. In addition, this approach simplifies the support and deployment of the system you develop - you can use an ordinary text editor to view and quickly modify the logic when necessary and also easily identify any element in the system by file name and line number in this file.</p>

In most cases, you only need to enter the "short" name of the element you're searching for and eventually write more concise and readable code. In addition, you can specify a class for each parameter in the code, and this class will also be taken into account during a search (i.e. explicit types are supported). This also makes your code shorter and simpler and ensures early error detection, smart auto-completion, and lots of other useful features.</p>

                <h2>Clustering</h2>
                <p>Since the application servers don't have any shared data, you can easily add as many of them as you need. In addition, the platform can transfer user data between database servers asynchronously, which, in turn, allows you to dynamically distribute the workload among them (e.g. when you add data to the database and need to use ACID, you can switch this processing to the master server or [in other cases] to the least busy slave servers).</p>

                <p>The extension technique allows developers to extend the functionality of one module in another (e.g. they can modify forms or classes created in another module). This mechanism makes the solutions you create much more modular.</p>

In addition, the platform allows you to group various form blocks into folders (tabs) for structuring large quantities of data. When the data is not visible to the user, it is not read/calculated (e.g. all lists are dynamic by default, i.e. only a limited number of objects are read initially, while the rest of them are read as the current object in the table is changed).</p>

Also, since relative (rather than absolute) positioning is used for the components, they are rendered in the web client natively using CSS (without JavaScript), which significantly improves UI responsiveness in the web client. In addition, neither the desktop nor the web client contain any application logic, which greatly simplifies their deployment (i.e. you can use the same client for any logic).</p>

Both processes are absolutely declarative and use the same concepts as the UI, which greatly simplifies interaction with external systems.</p>

                <p>Client-server communication at the physical level minimizes synchronous round-trip calls (i.e. each user action leads to a single - usually asynchronous - request/response pair). The desktop client also archives and encrypts all transferred data (when necessary). During client-server communication (via TCP/IP for the desktop client or HTTP for the Web client), the platform provides guarantee of delivery - it resends any lost requests and ensures that they are processed in the correct order. All these features help the platform run efficiently even on low-bandwidth, unstable, or high-latency communication channels.</p>

                <p>The platform supports access to the system via the most common general-purpose application protocol (HTTP), and the access interface includes not only execution of some action (with automatic argument parsing), but also execution of lsFusion code (as when accessing SQL servers). In addition, the platform at the language level supports access to SQL servers, other lsFusion systems, any external systems via HTTP, etc. And, since the server itself is implemented as a Spring bean, you can manage its life cycle using a standard Spring IoC container. All these features allow you to use lsFusion not only as a fully-fledged development platform, but also as a database or even as a Java library.</p>

                <p>The platform can safely roll back the state of the application server to the state at the start of any transaction. This allows you to use the native integrity tools of modern SQL servers, which not only significantly reduces labor costs and chances of human errors when developing a system for a highly concurrent environment, but also makes such a system much more scalable (provided that versioned DBMS are used).</p>

                <p>The application server runs on a Java virtual machine (JVM), which allows you to link any of the numerous existing Java libraries to it. All you have to do is create your Java action, register it with the platform, and then use it just like any other action written on the platform's language. Similarly, you can transparently use custom SQL functions of the database server you're using.</p>

                <h2>Everything as code</h2>
                <p>All elements of the system, from events to form design, are written in the lsFusion language and stored in plain text files (without any shared repositories with an unknown structure). This allows you to use popular version control systems (Git, Subversion) and project-building tools (Maven, Gradle, built into IDEs) when working with projects. In addition, this approach simplifies the support and deployment of the system you develop, because it allows, first, using a simple text editor to view and, if necessary, quickly modify the logic, and second, easily identify any element in the system, by its file and line number in this file.</p>

                <p>The platform allows you to group element names into namespaces and consider names in the same namespace as having higher priority when searching for elements. In most cases, you need to specify only the "short" name of the element you're searching, which makes the code more concise and readable. In addition, you can specify a class for each parameter in the code, and this class will also be taken into account during elements search (i.e. explicit typing is supported). This not only makes your code shorter and simpler, but also gives you early error detection, smart auto-completion, and lots of other useful features.</p>

                <h2>Three-tier architecture</h2>
                <p>The platform executes the imperative part of the system logic (i.e. everything related to data changes) on application servers and the declarative part (i.e. everything related to data calculations) on database servers. This separation simplifies the scaling of the system you develop and strengthens its fault tolerance due to the different nature of workload on these servers (e.g. using swap on an application server is much more dangerous than on a database server).</p>

                <h2>Clustering</h2>
                <p>Since the application servers don't have any shared data, you can easily add as many of them as you need. In addition, the platform can transfer user data between database servers asynchronously, which, in turn, allows you to dynamically distribute the workload among them. For example, if data is written to the database (and thus ACID is needed), performing processing on the masters, and in other cases - on the least loaded slaves.</p>

And, if inheritance isn't enough for you for whatever reason, the platform also provides an aggregation mechanism that, together with inheritance, allows you to implement almost any polymorphic logic.</p>

In addition, the platform allows the simultaneous editing of the same data (e.g. the same document), which can be critical if you have a lot of data or need to enter it very quickly.</p>

Moreover, if there is too much information, the platform allows you to group various form blocks into folders (tabs) and named collapsible containers. In this case, when the data is not visible to the user, it is not read/calculated (e.g. all lists are dynamic by default, i.e. only a limited number of objects are read initially, while the rest of them are read as the current object in the table is changed).</p>

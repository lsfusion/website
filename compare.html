    <p>Due to realizing the full potential of the six most advanced programming paradigms, lsFusion has the completeness of ERP platforms, outperforms SQL platforms in declarativeness and performance, while being almost as flexible and scalable as ORM platforms.<br /><br /> All this makes lsFusion a kind of silver bullet in business / web application development with not extremely large budgets and number of users.</p>

In addition, neither the desktop nor the web client contain any application logic, which greatly simplifies their deployment (i.e. you can use the same client for any logic).</span></span>
